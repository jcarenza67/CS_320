## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

* To ensure my software works correctly, I write and run thorough tests, both manual and automated, to catch bugs early. I also follow best coding practices like validating inputs, handling errors properly, and keeping my dependencies up to date. For security, I apply principles like least privilege, sanitize all user inputs to prevent injections, and stay informed about common vulnerabilities to avoid them

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

* I start by communicating closely with users or stakeholders to understand what they want and why. I ask clarifying questions and take notes to capture their requirements clearly. Then, I break down these needs into smaller features or tasks and prioritize them. Throughout development, I seek feedback and adjust the program to better fit the users’ expectations.

## How do I approach designing software?

* I begin with a clear understanding of the problem and user requirements. Then, I create simple models or diagrams to visualize the system structure and flow. I consider scalability, maintainability, and usability while choosing design patterns or architecture styles. I prefer iterative design—building a basic version first, then refining it based on testing and feedback.
